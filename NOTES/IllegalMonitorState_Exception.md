In Java, the ReentrantLock class enforces that only the thread that acquires the lock can release it. If you try to have a different thread release the lock, you will encounter the IllegalMonitorStateException

The java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException occurs in Java when you attempt to release a lock (such as by calling unlock() on a ReentrantLock) without holding it. In this case, the error suggests that the code is attempting to call unlock() on a ReentrantLock in the SeatManager.unlockTheSeat method, but the lock was not acquired by the same thread.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the cause and potential solutions:

Cause of IllegalMonitorStateException
Attempting to unlock without acquiring the lock: If a thread tries to unlock a ReentrantLock that it didn’t lock, Java throws an IllegalMonitorStateException.
Concurrency issue: This error often occurs in concurrent programming if a lock is used incorrectly, such as:
Calling unlock() in a different method or context from where lock() was called.
Attempting to unlock multiple times without corresponding lock() calls.
Possible Reasons in Your Code
Mismatched Lock and Unlock: The code may attempt to unlock() even if lock() was not called, or it may not check if the lock is already held before attempting to unlock.
Multiple Threads Attempting to Unlock: If two or more threads try to operate on the same seat concurrently, one thread might lock and unlock it, while another attempts to unlock it again, causing this error.
Solution
Ensure Proper Locking and Unlocking in the Same Thread:

Use lock() and unlock() within the same method or in a try-finally block to ensure that unlock() is only called if lock() was successfully acquired.
Use a conditional check to see if the current thread holds the lock before attempting to unlock.
Use try-finally Block for Locking/Unlocking: Wrapping the lock() and unlock() calls in a try-finally block helps prevent the lock from being left in an inconsistent state.

Key Takeaways
Always match lock() and unlock() calls in the same thread.
Use try-finally to ensure unlock() is called only after lock().
Check if the current thread holds the lock with lock.isHeldByCurrentThread() before unlocking.
This should prevent the IllegalMonitorStateException and improve the reliability of your concurrency logic.
